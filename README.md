**œÄ-Backend** transforms your Raspberry Pi into a powerful, multi-purpose server. It provides a robust RESTful API built with Flask, a persistent background service for data collection, and a deep integration with a wide range of hardware components. Whether you're building a personal dashboard, a remote sensor station, or a home automation hub, this project provides the foundational services you need.

## ‚ú® Features

| Feature                   | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üåê **RESTful API Server** | A secure, extensible API serving real-time data and control functions, powered by Flask and Gunicorn.     |
| üîÑ **Background Polling** | A `systemd` service runs on boot, automatically collecting and logging time-series data to a database.  |
| üîí **Unified Security** | Integrated user authentication (Argon2 hashing) and API key management for secure endpoint access.      |
| ü§ñ **Hardware Interface** | Direct control and data retrieval from Sense HAT, GPS/GNSS modules, LTE modems, and Bluetooth.          |
| ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Service Bridge** | Aggregates data from multiple external weather and location APIs (OpenWeather, NOAA, Windy, etc.).      |
| üõ∞Ô∏è **Local Services** | Provides local information like nearby points of interest (police, fire stations) and astronomy data. |
| üóÑÔ∏è **Database-Driven** | All application data, logs, and configuration are managed within a central SQLite database.            |
| üöÄ **Automated Installer** | A comprehensive installer script handles all dependencies, setup, service installation, and updates.  |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Services

### 1. RESTful API Server (`app.py`)

The heart of the project is the Flask API server, run as a `gunicorn` process and managed by `systemd`. It exposes all hardware and data functions through a set of secure, authenticated endpoints.

### 2. Background Data Poller (`data_poller.py`)

The `pi_backend_poller` is a persistent background service that starts on boot. Its primary role is to automatically collect time-series data from its own API and external sources, storing the results in the database. This ensures a continuous log of sensor, GPS, and weather data without requiring an active frontend client.

Polling frequencies are now managed in the database and can be configured via the web UI.

## üöÄ Installation & Management

The entire lifecycle of the application is managed by a single, powerful installer script.

### Prerequisites

- A Raspberry Pi running a recent 64-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS.
- An active internet connection for the initial setup.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Download Project:** Get the `pi_backend` project files onto your Raspberry Pi.
2.  **Make Executable:** Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    chmod +x setup.sh
    ```
3.  **Run Installer:** Execute the script as a regular user (it will ask for `sudo` when needed).
    ```bash
    ./setup.sh
    ```

The script will guide you through an interactive menu to handle:
- **First-Time Installation:** Installs all dependencies, deploys files, configures hardware, and sets up the `systemd` services.
- **Updates & Patches:** Compares local files against the source and applies updates as needed.
- **Service Management:** Start, stop, and check the status of all backend services.
- **Full Uninstall:** Securely removes all files and configurations.

## üîê Security

All API endpoints (with the exception of initial setup routes) are protected and require authentication.

- **User Authentication:** Use Basic Authentication with a username and password. An `admin` user can be created through the web UI on the first run if no users exist in the database.
- **API Key Authentication:** Pass a valid API key in the `X-API-Key` request header. Keys can be generated and managed in the **Keys & Admin** tab of the web dashboard.

## üì° API Endpoint Guide

### Authentication
All requests must include either Basic Auth credentials or an `X-API-Key` header.

## üîß Configuration

The `pi_backend` uses a database-first approach for configuration.

1.  **Initial Setup:** On the very first run, a `setup_config.ini` file is used to determine essential system paths.
2.  **Database Migration:** The installer immediately migrates all settings from this `.ini` file into the main application database (`pi_backend.db`). The `.ini` file is then removed.
3.  **Ongoing Management:** All subsequent configuration changes (API keys, polling intervals, etc.) are managed directly through the web dashboard, providing a central and secure way to control the application.
