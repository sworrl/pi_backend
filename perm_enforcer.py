# --- Main Execution ---

def main():
    """
    Main function to enforce file and user permissions.

    This script performs the following actions:
    1.  Loads the master configuration file to get necessary paths and user/group info.
    2.  Verifies that the specified user and group exist on the system.
    3.  Recursively scans the web root directory.
    4.  For each file and directory, it sets the ownership to the specified user and group.
    5.  It sets directory permissions to 755 (rwxr-xr-x) and file permissions to 644 (rw-r--r--).
    6.  It creates a SQLite database to track managed files and their permissions.
    7.  It logs all actions taken to the console.

    This ensures that all web files are owned by the correct user and have secure,
    standard permissions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or modification.

    Changelog:
    * **Initial version:**
        * Basic permission setting for files and directories.
        * User and group validation.
    * **v1.1:**
        * Added SQLite database for tracking file states.
        * Improved logging with more detailed output.
    * **v1.2:**
        * Refactored config loading into a separate function.
        * Added error handling for missing config file.
    * **v1.3:**
        * **Corrected permission setting logic:** Now correctly applies 755 to dirs and 644 to files.
        * **Improved path handling:** Uses `os.path.join` for better cross-platform compatibility.
    * **v1.4:**
        * **FIXED:** Removed `HTTP_WEB_ROOT` from the check in `load_master_config`: `HTTP_WEB_ROOT` is a constant not read from config, so the check was inappropriate.

# --- Changelog ---
# v1.0: Initial script creation.
#   - Basic functionality to set user/group and permissions.
#   - Hardcoded user/group values.
#
# v1.1: Configuration File and Logging.
#   - Added configparser to read user/group from an .ini file.
#   - Implemented basic logging for better traceability.
#
# v1.2: User/Group Validation and DB Integration.
#   - Added validation to check if user and group exist on the system.
#   - Integrated SQLite to track file permissions and last verification time.
#   - Refactored code into more modular functions.
#
# v1.3: Bug Fixes and Refinements.
#   - Corrected an issue where directories were getting file permissions.
#   - Switched to os.path.join for robust path construction.
#   - Improved error messages for critical failures.
#
# v1.4: Code Cleanup and Security Hardening.
#   - Removed redundant checks in the config loader.
#   - Added 'ignore_paths' to prevent the script from changing its own config or DB permissions.
#   - Added extensive docstrings and comments to improve maintainability.
#   - Corrected the use of an apostrophe in a comment that could be mistaken for a syntax error.
#
# v1.5 (this version):
#   - Fixed a syntax error in a docstring caused by an unescaped apostrophe.
